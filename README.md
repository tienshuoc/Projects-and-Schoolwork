* Cargo Transportation Flow Network (FordFulkerson Algorithm implementation)

## **Machine Learning (Junior Year)**
Code written in python, mostly using Jupyter notebooks:
* <b>Lab0:</b> Linear Regression on concrete strength prediction
* <b>Lab1:</b> PCA, Kmeans on mango dataset → classify mangos by color (red/green)
* <b>Lab2:</b> Logistic Regression & K-Nearest Neighbors on 12 features to determine normal or abnormal backpain
* <b>Lab3:</b> Handcode MLP network (backpropagation, gradient update...) on handwritten character classification
* <b>Lab4:</b> Image classification with Pytorch library to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia
* <b>Lab5:</b> LSTM implementation on PTT gossip dataset to create simple chatbot
* <b>Lab6:</b> General Adversarial Networks (GAN) on LLD logo dataset to create novel logos
* <b>Midterm Project:</b> Classify mango quality based on images, using classical machine learning methods (SVM, LR, KNN, XG-Boost, Ensembling)
 * <b>Final Project:</b> Enter mango quality classifying competition, using pretrained deep neural network (VGG) and more advanced feature extraction methods (Image  Segmentation) → <b> Ranked: 26/538 </b> (Prelminary Round, Final Round still ongoing) 

## **Introduction to VLSI (Junior Year)**
